# ðŸŒž Solar Radiation Simulation Tool

This project is an interactive web application built with **Python** and **Streamlit** to estimate the solar radiation transmitted and absorbed through a window, with and without an additional protective layer.

âœ… **Key Features**
- Calculates absorbed and transmitted solar radiation based on glazing type, area, and irradiance.
- Allows adding a custom protective layer with thickness and absorption coefficient.
- Compares results with and without the extra layer.
- Visualizes the window dimensions dynamically.
- Lets you save different simulation cases and export results as a CSV file.
